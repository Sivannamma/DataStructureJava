# DataStructureJava
This repository contains work that have been done in the class data structure.
This class was generaly about the ways we can store data, the benefits of each structure, and in some part was focused on the diffrences between the sorts we have in the programming world.
This repository contains several classes, starting with BST, ABVL tree, Queue, Stack, all implemented by me.
